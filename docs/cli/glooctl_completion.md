## glooctl completion

generate auto completion for your shell

### Synopsis


	Output shell completion code for the specified shell (bash or zsh).
	The shell code must be evaluated to provide interactive
	completion of glooctl commands.  This can be done by sourcing it from
	the .bash_profile.
	Note for zsh users: [1] zsh completions are only supported in versions of zsh >= 5.2

```

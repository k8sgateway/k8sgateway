  The Function Gateway

### What is Gloo?

Gloo is a high-performance, plugin-extendable, platform-agnostic API Gateway built on top of Envoy. Gloo is designed for microservice, monolithic, and serverless applications. By employing function-level routing, Gloo can completely decouple client APIs from upstream APIs at the routing level. Gloo serves as an abstraction layer between clients and upstream services, allowing front-end teams to work independently of teams developing the microservices their apps connect to.

## Features

**Microservice Platform Integrations with Service Discovery**:

* Kubernetes
* OpenShift
* HashiCorp Stack (Vault, Consul, Nomad)
* Cloud Foundry

**Serverless Platform Integrations with Function Discovery**:

* AWS Lambda
* Microsoft Azure Functions
* Google Cloud Platform Functions
* Fission
* OpenFaaS
* ProjectFn

**Routing Features**:

* **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Load balance traffic across multiple upstream services.
* **Health Checks**: Active and passive monitoring of your upstream services.
* **OpenTracing**: Monitor requests using the well-supported OpenTracing standard
* **Monitoring**: Export HTTP metrics to Prometheus or Statsd
* **SSL**: Highly customizable options for adding SSL encryption to upstream services with full support for SNI.
* **Transformations**: Add, remove, or manipulate HTTP requests and responses.
* **Automated API Translation**: Automatically transform client requests to upstream API calls using Glooâ€™s Function Discovery
* **CLI**: Control your Gloo cluster from the command line.
* **Declarative API**: Gloo features a declarative YAML-based API; store your configuration as code and commit it with your projects.
* **Failure Recovery**: Gloo is completely stateless and will immediately return to the desired configuration at boot time.
* **Scalability**: Gloo acts as a control plane for Envoy, allowing Envoy instances and Gloo instances to be scaled independently. Both Gloo and Envoy are stateless.
* **Performance**: Gloo leverages Envoy for its high performance and low footprint.
* **Plugins**: Extendable architecture for adding functionality and integrations to Gloo.
* **Tooling**: Build and Deployment tool for customized builds and deployment options
* **Events**: Invoke APIs using CloudEvents.
* **Pub/Sub**: Publish HTTP requests to NATS
* **JSON-to-gRPC transcoding**: Connect JSON clients to gRPC services

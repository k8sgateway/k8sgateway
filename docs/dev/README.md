# Developer Guide

Developing on Gloo can be a fun and highly rewarding experience. 

Gloo is designed to be highly pluggable and easily extendable in each of the following domains:

- Routing Controllers (e.g. defining new APIs, automatic config in response to events, etc.)
- Service Discovery backends
- Configuring custom or upstream Envoy Filters

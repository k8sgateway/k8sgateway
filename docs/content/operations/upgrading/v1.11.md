Review the changes in Gloo Edge 1.11.x and Gloo Edge Enterprise 1.11.x, and apply the version-specific changes before upgrading your Gloo Edge installation.

{{% notice warning %}}
New CRDs are automatically applied to your cluster when performing a `helm install` operation.
However, they are not applied when performing an `helm upgrade` operation. This is a [deliberate design choice](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#limitations-on-crds) on the part of the
Helm maintainers, given the risk associated with changing CRDs. Given this limitation, you must apply new CRDs to the cluster before upgrading.

## CRD changes

**New and updated CRDs**
- The GraphQL CR is renamed to `GraphQLApi` (as of release 1.11.0-beta16), and its version has been changed from `v1alpha1` to `v1beta1` (as of release 1.11.0).
- The Settings CR is updated to include [`consoleOptions` configuration settings]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/settings.proto.sk/#consoleoptions" %}}) for the Gloo Enterprise UI.

**Deprecated CRDs**
None

**Removed CRDs**
- The previous GraphQL CR name, `GraphQLSchema` (as referenced in the [1.10 upgrade guide]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/v1.10/#installing-the-new-graphqlschema-crd" %}})), is removed.

## Apply CRD changes

To upgrade Gloo Edge:

1. Follow the steps in [Upgrade Steps]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/upgrade_steps/" %}}) to prepare for upgrading, and to upgrade `glooctl`.

2. Delete the removed/outdated CRDs (if applicable).
   ```sh
   kubectl delete crd graphqlschemas.graphql.gloo.solo.io
   kubectl delete crd graphqlapis.graphql.gloo.solo.io
   ```

3. Apply the new and updated CRDs.
   ```sh
   helm pull gloo/gloo --version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest.md" markdown="true">}} --untar
   kubectl apply -f gloo/crds
   ```

4. Continue to [upgrade the Gloo Edge server components]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/upgrade_steps/#step-4-upgrade-gloo-edge" %}}) via Helm.

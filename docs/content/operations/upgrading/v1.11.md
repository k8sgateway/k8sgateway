title: 1.11.0+ Upgrade Notice
weight: 40
description: Migrating to Gloo Edge 1.11.x and Gloo Edge Enterprise 1.11.x
---

Upgrade your Gloo Edge or Gloo Edge Enterprise deployments to version 1.11 from previous verisions. 

This upgrade guide assumes that you installed Gloo Edge with Helm or `glooctl`. You can verify this installation by checking for a Helm chart release named `gloo` in the output of `helm ls --all-namespaces`.

For steps to avoid downtime during upgrades, check out the [Recommended settings]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/upgrade_steps#upgrading-the-server-components" >}}).

## Apply new CRDs

{{% notice warning %}}
New CRDs are automatically applied to your cluster when performing a `helm install` operation.
However, they are not applied when performing an `helm upgrade` operation. This is a [deliberate design choice](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#limitations-on-crds) on the part of the
Helm maintainers, given the risk associated with changing CRDs. Given this limitation, you need to apply the new CRD to the cluster before upgrading.

**New CRDs**
None

**Updated CRDs**
- In 1.11 the GraphQL CR is renamed to `GraphQLApi`, from the previous name `GraphQLSchema` (as referenced in the [1.10 upgrade guide]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/v1.10/#installing-the-new-graphqlschema-crd" %}})).

## Verify upgrade

Verify that your upgrade was successful.

1. Verify that all server components run the expected version.
   ```shell script
   glooctl version
   ```

2. Check the health of your Gloo Edge installation.
   ```shell script
   glooctl check
   ```

   Example output of a successful upgrade:
   ```shell script
   Checking deployments... OK
   Checking pods... OK
   Checking upstreams... OK
   Checking upstream groups... OK
   Checking auth configs... OK
   Checking rate limit configs... OK
   Checking VirtualHostOptions... OK

   No problems detected.
   ```

## Upgrade glooctl

After you upgrade Gloo Edge, you must also [upgrade your `glooctl` CLI]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/preparation/#update-glooctl" %}}). When you upgrade, specify the Gloo Edge OSS version that corresponds to the Gloo Edge Enterprise version you upgraded to. To find the OSS version that corresponds to each Gloo Edge Enterprise release, see the [Gloo Edge Enterprise changelogs]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/changelog/enterprise/" %}}).

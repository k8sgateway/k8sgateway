title: 1.9.0+ Upgrade Notice
weight: 5
description: Migrating to Gloo Edge 1.9.x and Gloo Edge Enterprise 1.9.x
---

In this guide we will describe the necessary steps to upgrade your Gloo Edge or Gloo Edge Enterprise deployments to their `1.9`
versions. We recommend that you follow these steps only after you have followed our [guide to upgrade to 1.8]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/1.8.0" >}}).

This upgrade guide also assumes that was gloo installed via `helm` or with `glooctl` version 1.8.0+
(i.e., gloo is a helm release named "gloo", which you can confirm exists by running `helm ls --all-namespaces`).

Also, please make sure to check out our [general configuration recommendations]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/upgrade_steps#upgrading-the-server-components" >}}) to avoid downtime during upgrades.

##### CRD field updates

Any new fields added to our CRDs (e.g. added between 1.8.0 -> 1.9.0) need to be added to our validation schemas.

To apply the new CRDs:
```
helm pull gloo/gloo --version $GLOO_VERSION --untar #e.g. GLOO_VERSION=1.9.0
kubectl apply -f gloo/crds
```

Note: To support k8s 1.22, Gloo Edge CRDs are now written as v1 rather than v1beta1. CRDs that have been persisted as
v1beta1 can be read using the v1 API in k8s 1.22 and are converted on read to the new API.

##### Verify upgrade
To verify that your upgrade was successful, let's first check the version:

```shell script
glooctl version
```

You should see the expected version for all the server components.

Let's also check that your Gloo Edge installation is healthy by running:

```shell script
glooctl check
```

If everything went well, you should see the following output:

```shell script
Checking deployments... OK
Checking pods... OK
Checking upstreams... OK
Checking upstream groups... OK
Checking auth configs... OK
Checking rate limit configs... OK
Checking VirtualHostOptions... OK

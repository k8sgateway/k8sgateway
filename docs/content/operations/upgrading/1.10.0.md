title: 1.10.0+ Upgrade Notice
weight: 40
description: Migrating to Gloo Edge 1.10.x and Gloo Edge Enterprise 1.10.x
---

Follow these steps to upgrade your Gloo Edge or Gloo Edge Enterprise deployments to version 1.10 from previous verisions. 

This upgrade guide assumes that you installed Gloo Edge with Helm or `glooctl`. You can verify this installation by checking for a Helm chart release named `gloo` in the output of `helm ls --all-namespaces`.

For steps to avoid downtime during upgrades, check out the [Recommended settings]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/upgrade_steps#upgrading-the-server-components" >}}).

## Helm Breaking Changes
- Prior to Gloo Edge Enterprise version v1.10, `license_secret_name` could be specified at the top level of your helm
`values.yaml` file. However, in order to use this option now, this must be specified under `gloo.license_secret_name`.
```yaml
--- values.yaml ---
license_secret_name: some-license-secret

# the above becomes
--- new-values.yaml ---
gloo:
  license_secret_name: some-license-secret
```

## Verify upgrade
To verify that your upgrade was successful, let's first check the version:

```shell script
glooctl version
```

You should see the expected version for all the server components.

Let's also check that your Gloo Edge installation is healthy by running:

```shell script
glooctl check
```

If everything went well, you should see the following output:

```shell script
Checking deployments... OK
Checking pods... OK
Checking upstreams... OK
Checking upstream groups... OK
Checking auth configs... OK
Checking rate limit configs... OK
Checking VirtualHostOptions... OK

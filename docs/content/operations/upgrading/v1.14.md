## Feature changes {#features}

Review the following highlights of features changes in Gloo Edge version 1.14.

<!--TODO add links-->

**New or improved features**:
* **Improved AWS Lambda response transformations**: UnwrapAsApiGateway, previously a Gloo Edge Enterprise feature, has been migrated to Gloo Edge. The setting `responseTransformation` has been revised to configure this feature instead. Consequently, the feature `responseTransformation` will no longer hard-code the response's `Content-Type` header to `text/html`. Additionally, it is now treated as an error when `UnwrapAsAlb` and `UnwrapAsApiGateway`/`responseTransformation` are configured simultaneously. This is a potentially breaking change from the prior behavior whereby Gloo Edge would prioritize UnwrapAsAlb when both were set.

**Deprecated features**:
* AWS Lambda responseTransformation

**Removed features**:
<!-- * None -->

## CRD changes {#crd}

{{% notice warning %}}
New CRDs are automatically applied to your cluster when performing a `helm install` operation. However, they are not applied when performing an `helm upgrade` operation. This is a [deliberate design choice](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#limitations-on-crds) on the part of the Helm maintainers, given the risk associated with changing CRDs. Given this limitation, you must apply new CRDs to the cluster before upgrading.

{{% /notice %}}

1. Follow steps 1 - 2 in [Upgrade Steps]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/upgrade_steps/" %}}) to prepare for upgrading, and to upgrade `glooctl`.

2. Apply the new and updated CRDs. Replace the version with the specific patch version that you are upgrading to, such as `1.14.0` in the following examples.

   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Gloo Edge" %}}
   ```sh
   helm repo update
   helm pull gloo/gloo --version 1.14.0 --untar
   kubectl apply -f gloo/crds
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="Gloo Edge Enterprise" %}}
   ```sh
   helm repo update
   helm pull glooe/gloo-ee --version 1.14.0 --untar
   kubectl apply -f gloo-ee/charts/gloo/crds
   # If Gloo Federation is enabled
   kubectl apply -f gloo-ee/charts/gloo-fed/crds
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

3. Enable any [new features](#features) that you want to use, such as UnwrapAsApiGateway.

4. Continue to [upgrade the Gloo Edge server components]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/upgrade_steps/#step-4-upgrade-gloo-edge" %}}) via Helm.

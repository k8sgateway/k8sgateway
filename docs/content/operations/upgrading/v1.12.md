Review the changes in Gloo Edge 1.12.x and Gloo Edge Enterprise 1.12.x, and apply the version-specific changes before upgrading your Gloo Edge installation.

{{% notice warning %}}
New CRDs are automatically applied to your cluster when performing a `helm install` operation.
However, they are not applied when performing an `helm upgrade` operation. This is a [deliberate design choice](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#limitations-on-crds) on the part of the
Helm maintainers, given the risk associated with changing CRDs. Given this limitation, you must apply new CRDs to the cluster before upgrading.

## Architectural changes

To reduce cross-pod communication, the gateway functionality is removed from a standalone pod, and is now included in the Gloo Edge control plane pod. Specifically, the validation webhook is moved to the Gloo pod, which reduces the number of GRPC calls required for validation.

The following changes apply to your Gloo Edge installation in 1.13.x:
- **Installed pods**: The `gateway` pod is removed from the [set of installed components]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/enterprise/#verify-your-installation" %}}).
- **Installation settings**:
  - Because the `gateway` pod is no longer installed, specify any environment variables for the gateway on the `gloo` deployment instead. For example, in your Helm values file, you might set the `PROXY_STATUS_MAX_SIZE_BYTES` environment variable to truncate the length of the proxy status field:
    ```
    gloo:
      deployment:
        customEnv:
          - name: "PROXY_STATUS_MAX_SIZE_BYTES"
            value: "100"
    ```
  - To improve performance, the proxy CRD is not written to etcd by default and is instead kept in memory. If you must allow external tools and other pods to read the proxy CR contents, you can persist them to etcd by setting the `gateway.persistProxySpec` setting to `true` in your Helm values file.
- **Proxy CR contents**: To view the contents of a proxy CR, you can continue to use the `glooctl get proxy <proxy> -o yaml` command. However, because the proxy CRD is no longer written to etcd by default, you cannot use `kubectl` commands to check proxy CR contents.
- **Snapshot metrics**: The `gateway` snapshot is removed. If you use metrics from the gateway snapshot, those metrics are moved to the `gloo` snapshot; for example, `api_gloosnapshot_gloo_solo_io_emitter_*`.

## CRD changes

**New and updated CRDs**
- In the ExtAuth CR, the `spec.configs.oauth2.oidcAuthorizationCode.headers` section is updated to include the `useBearerSchemaForAuthorization` setting to add the “Bearer” prefix to the upstream access token header value (`"Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"`). In Gloo Edge 1.12, this setting defaults to false. In Gloo Edge 1.13, this setting will default to true. For more information, see the [ExtAuth reference documentation]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/enterprise/options/extauth/v1/extauth.proto.sk/#headerconfiguration" %}}).

**Deprecated CRDs**
None

**Removed CRDs**
None

## Apply CRD changes

To upgrade Gloo Edge:

1. Follow steps 1 - 2 in [Upgrade Steps]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/upgrade_steps/" %}}) to prepare for upgrading, and to upgrade `glooctl`.

2. Apply the new and updated CRDs.
   ```sh
   helm pull gloo/gloo --version 1.12.0 --untar
   kubectl apply -f gloo/crds
   ```

3. Prepare for any updates you want to make related to the [gateway architectural changes](#architectural-changes). For example, you might want to create a Helm values file to pass gateway environment variables to the `gloo` pod during the Helm upgrade, or update any systems that watch for snapshot metrics.

4. Continue to [upgrade the Gloo Edge server components]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/upgrade_steps/#step-4-upgrade-gloo-edge" %}}) via Helm.

5. If you use the `spec.configs.oauth2.oidcAuthorizationCode.headers.accessTokenHeader: "Authorization"` setting in any `AuthConfig` resources, and you do _not_ want to add the “Bearer” prefix to the header, set `useBearerSchemaForAuthorization` to `false`. In Gloo Edge 1.13, this setting will default to true if not set.

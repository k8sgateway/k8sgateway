title: 1.8.0+ Upgrade Notice
weight: 5
description: Migrating to Gloo Edge 1.8.x and Gloo Edge Enterprise 1.8.x
---

In this guide we will describe the necessary steps to upgrade your Gloo Edge or Gloo Edge Enterprise deployments to their `1.8`
versions. We recommend that you follow these steps only after you have followed our [guide to upgrade to 1.7]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/1.7.0" >}}).

This upgrade guide also assumes that was gloo installed via `helm` or with `glooctl` version 1.7.0+
(i.e., gloo is a helm release named "gloo", which you can confirm exists by running `helm ls --all-namespaces`).

Also, please make sure to check out our [general configuration recommendations]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/upgrade_steps#upgrading-the-server-components" >}}) to avoid downtime during upgrades.

### Breaking Changes

#### Open Source

###### CRDs with Validation Schemas
Gloo Edge CRDs now include an OpenAPI v3.0 validation schema with structural schema constraints (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#specifying-a-structural-schema).
Previously custom resources could be defined with yaml that contained snake_case or camelCase fields. For example, the following definition was valid:

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=10-12" >}}
apiVersion: gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: Upstream
metadata:
  name: default-productpage-9080
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  kube:
    selector:
      app: productpage
    service_name: productpage
    service_namespace: default
    service_port: 9080
{{< /highlight >}}

The validation schemas require that fields be defined using camelCase. The previous definition should be converted to:

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=10-12" >}}
apiVersion: gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: Upstream
metadata:
  name: default-productpage-9080
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  kube:
    selector:
      app: productpage
    serviceName: productpage
    serviceNamespace: default
    servicePort: 9080
{{< /highlight >}}

If you do not make this change, you will see the following type of error:
`ValidationError(Upstream.spec.kube): unknown field "service_name" in io.solo.gloo.v1.Upstream.spec.kube`

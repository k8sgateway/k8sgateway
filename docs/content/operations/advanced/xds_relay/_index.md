{{% notice warning %}}
xDS relay is available in Gloo Edge 1.11.x and later as a beta feature. This feature is not supported for the following non-default installation modes of Gloo Edge: REST Endpoint Discovery (EDS), Gloo Edge mTLS mode, Gloo Edge with Istio mTLS mode.
{{% /notice %}}

To protect against control plane downtime, you can install Gloo Edge alongside the `xds-relay` Helm chart. This Helm chart installs a deployment of `xds-relay` pods that serve as intermediaries between Envoy proxies and the xDS server of Gloo Edge.

The presence of `xds-relay` intermediary pods serve two purposes. First, it separates the lifecycle of Gloo Edge from the xDS cache proxies. For example, a failure during a Helm upgrade will not cause the loss of the last valid xDS state. Second, it allows you to scale `xds-relay` to as many replicas as needed, since Gloo Edge uses only one replica. Without `xds-relay`, a failure of the single Gloo Edge replica causes any new Envoy proxies to be created without a valid configuration.

1. Install the `xds-relay` Helm chart, which supports version 2 and 3 of the Envoy API.
   ```shell
   helm repo add xds-relay https://storage.googleapis.com/xds-relay-helm
   helm repo upgrade
   helm install xdsrelay xds-relay/xds-relay
   ```

2. Optional: Modify the default values for the `xds-relay` chart, such as to add resource requests and limits.
   ```yaml
   deployment:
     replicas: 3
     image:
       pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
       registry: gcr.io/gloo-edge
       repository: xds-relay
       tag: %version%
   # might want to set resources for prod deploy, e.g.:
   #  resources:
   #    requests:
   #      cpu: 125m
   #      memory: 256Mi
   service:
     port: 9991
   bootstrap:
     cache:
       # zero means no limit
       ttl: 0s
       # zero means no limit
       maxEntries: 0
     originServer:
       address: gloo.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local
       port: 9977
       streamTimeout: 5s
     logging:
       level: INFO
   # might want to add extra, non-default identifiers
   #extraLabels:
   #  k: v
   #extraTemplateAnnotations:
   #  k: v
   ```

3. [Install Gloo Edge]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/enterprise/" >}}) with the following Helm values to point each Envoy proxy (envoy) to `xds-relay`.
```yaml
gatewayProxies:
  gatewayProxy: # do the following for each gateway proxy
    xdsServiceAddress: xds-relay.default.svc.cluster.local
    xdsServicePort: 9991
```

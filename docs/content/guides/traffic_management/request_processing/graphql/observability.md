## UI

I have a basic walkthrough of the UI here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RnHCx1diNebjZ2nShFjstTe_Xord56hE

It would be good to discuss the basic workflows with screen captures and summary:
API listing / registry page
The API Details page - viewing an existing API
Explorer - invoking an API (similar to Try It Now in Portal)
Creating a new GraphQL API through the UI

## Observability

This is the complete set of metrics we have right now:

```
envoy_gloo_system_bookinfo_graphql_graphql_Query_productsForHome_rest_resolver_failed_resolutions
envoy_gloo_system_bookinfo_graphql_graphql_Query_productsForHome_rest_resolver_total_resolutions
envoy_gloo_system_bookinfo_graphql_graphql_author_rest_resolver_failed_resolutions 
envoy_gloo_system_bookinfo_graphql_graphql_author_rest_resolver_total_resolutions
envoy_gloo_system_bookinfo_graphql_graphql_pages_rest_resolver_failed_resolutions

envoy_gloo_system_bookinfo_graphql_graphql_review_rest_resolver_failed_resolutions envoy_gloo_system_bookinfo_graphql_graphql_review_rest_resolver_total_resolutions
envoy_gloo_system_bookinfo_graphql_graphql_rq_error
envoy_gloo_system_bookinfo_graphql_graphql_rq_invalid_query_error
envoy_gloo_system_bookinfo_graphql_graphql_rq_parse_json_error
envoy_gloo_system_bookinfo_graphql_graphql_rq_parse_query_error
envoy_gloo_system_bookinfo_graphql_graphql_rq_total
envoy_gloo_system_bookinfo_graphql_graphql_year_rest_resolver_failed_resolutions
envoy_gloo_system_bookinfo_graphql_graphql_year_rest_resolver_total_resolutions
```

These are envoy stats that are also available through the Prometheus (and then Grafana if customers want to visualize through a dashboard)

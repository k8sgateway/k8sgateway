[Gloo Gateway](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-gateway) is the latest open source-based, API gateway product by Solo.io. As part of Gloo Platform, you get observability, multitenancy, and multicluster support from Day 1, alongside seamless integration with Gloo Mesh and Gloo Network. To use Gloo Gateway with an Istio service mesh, add a [Gloo Mesh](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-mesh-enterprise) license as part of your Gloo Platform installation.

For steps to set up Gloo Edge as the ingress for a cluster with an Istio service mesh, review [Gloo Edge and Istio mTLS](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/1.9.24/guides/integrations/service_mesh/gloo_istio_mtls/). Note that you might have to update these steps for your version of Gloo Edge and Istio.

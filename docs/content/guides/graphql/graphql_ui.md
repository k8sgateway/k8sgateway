I have a basic walkthrough of the UI here:

It would be good to discuss the basic workflows with screen captures and summary:
API listing / registry page
The API Details page - viewing an existing API
Explorer - invoking an API (similar to Try It Now in Portal)
Creating a new GraphQL API through the UI

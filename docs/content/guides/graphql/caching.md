There are three parts to this:
- How we automatically cache upstream responses in the resolver layer. No user configuration required - we’re just describing the behavior and why it’s good.
- Automatic persisted queries: https://github.com/solo-io/envoy-gloo-ee/issues/272
- Response Caching: This is basically piggybacking on the response caching support we’re doing for Edge https://github.com/solo-io/envoy-gloo-ee/issues/260

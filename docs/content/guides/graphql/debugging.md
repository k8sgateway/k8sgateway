It would be great to have a set of steps for how to debug issues. Iâ€™m thinking:
- Enabling debug logging for Envoy
- Example of a typical log output for a single GraphQL API request
- Checking status on relevant CRs (GraphQLSchema, VirtualService, Gateway)
- Checking metrics to see activity
- Any other control plane logging that might be relevant

```yaml
"cpuUtilization": float
"memUtilization": float
"rps": int
"requestCost": map<string, float>
"utilization": map<string, float>
"rpsFractional": float
"eps": float
"namedMetrics": map<string, float>

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `cpuUtilization` | `float` | CPU utilization expressed as a fraction of available CPU resources. This should be derived from the latest sample or measurement. |
| `memUtilization` | `float` | Memory utilization expressed as a fraction of available memory resources. This should be derived from the latest sample or measurement. |
| `rps` | `int` | Total RPS being served by an endpoint. This should cover all services that an endpoint is responsible for. Deprecated -- use ``rps_fractional`` field instead. |
| `requestCost` | `map<string, float>` | Application specific requests costs. Each value is an absolute cost (e.g. 3487 bytes of storage) associated with the request. |
| `utilization` | `map<string, float>` | Resource utilization values. Each value is expressed as a fraction of total resources available, derived from the latest sample or measurement. |
| `rpsFractional` | `float` | Total RPS being served by an endpoint. This should cover all services that an endpoint is responsible for. |
| `eps` | `float` | Total EPS (errors/second) being served by an endpoint. This should cover all services that an endpoint is responsible for. |
| `namedMetrics` | `map<string, float>` | Application specific opaque metrics. |

### HeaderValidationSettings



```yaml
"allowCustomHeaderMethods": bool

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `allowCustomHeaderMethods` | `bool` | As of right now, this field is only supported on HTTP/1 connections. When Universal Header Validation is enabled in Envoy, this field will apply to all HTTP protocols. TODO: let's think a bit more carefully about how we want to design this for future-proofing purposes. I think we may want to consider having an oneof here instead that could be something like (allow default methods/allow all methods/custom allow-list). we may also want to model our API similarly to upstream Envoy's UHV API WARNING: these options should not be considered stable, and this API is subject to change in the future. question: alternately, we could enable this as an HTTP/1-only option, mark it as deprecated, and then when UHV is enabled, we could remove the deprecated option and introduce a new option for all HTTP protocols. |

### ProxyLatency

 
Configure the proxy latency filter. This filter measures the latency
incurred by the filter chain in a histogram.

```yaml
"request": .envoy.config.filter.http.proxylatency.v2.ProxyLatency.Measurement
"response": .envoy.config.filter.http.proxylatency.v2.ProxyLatency.Measurement
"chargeClusterStat": .google.protobuf.BoolValue
"chargeListenerStat": .google.protobuf.BoolValue

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `request` | [.envoy.config.filter.http.proxylatency.v2.ProxyLatency.Measurement](../proxylatency.proto.sk/#measurement) | How to measure the request. |  |
| `response` | [.envoy.config.filter.http.proxylatency.v2.ProxyLatency.Measurement](../proxylatency.proto.sk/#measurement) | How measure the response. |  |
| `chargeClusterStat` | [.google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value) | Charge a stat per upstream cluster. If not specified, defaults to true. |  |
| `chargeListenerStat` | [.google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value) | Charge a stat per listener. If not specified, defaults to true. |  |

### Measurement

 
How to perform the latency measurement. Given an incoming request from downstream and
outging request to upstream; or incoming response from upstream and outgoing repsonse to
downstream, This outlines how to measure the latency used by the proxy.
Latency is measured in milliseconds will appear as a histogram in the envoy stats, with the
'proxy_latency' prefix.

| Name | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | 
| `LAST_INCOMING_FIRST_OUTGOING` | Count from the last byte of the incoming request\response to the first byte of the outgoing request\response. |
| `FIRST_INCOMING_FIRST_OUTGOING` | Count from the first byte of the incoming request\response to the first byte of the outgoing request\response. |
| `LAST_INCOMING_LAST_OUTGOING` | Count from the last byte of the incoming request\response to the last byte of the outgoing request\response. |
| `FIRST_INCOMING_LAST_OUTGOING` | Count from the first byte of the incoming request\response to the last byte of the outgoing request\response. |

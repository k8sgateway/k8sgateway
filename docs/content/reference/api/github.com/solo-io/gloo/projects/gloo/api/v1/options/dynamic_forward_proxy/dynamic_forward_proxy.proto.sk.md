### PerRouteConfig

 
Per route Configuration for the dynamic forward proxy HTTP filter.

```yaml
"hostRewrite": string
"autoHostRewriteHeader": string

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `hostRewrite` | `string` | Indicates that before DNS lookup, the host header will be swapped with this value. If not set or empty, the original host header value will be used and no rewrite will happen. Note: this rewrite affects both DNS lookup and host header forwarding. However, this option shouldn't be used with :ref:`HCM host rewrite <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.host_rewrite>` given that the value set here would be used for DNS lookups whereas the value set in the HCM would be used for host header forwarding which is not the desired outcome. Only one of `hostRewrite` or `autoHostRewriteHeader` can be set. |
| `autoHostRewriteHeader` | `string` | Indicates that before DNS lookup, the host header will be swapped with the value of this header. If not set or empty, the original host header value will be used and no rewrite will happen. Note: this rewrite affects both DNS lookup and host header forwarding. However, this option shouldn't be used with :ref:`HCM host rewrite header <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.auto_host_rewrite_header>` given that the value set here would be used for DNS lookups whereas the value set in the HCM would be used for host header forwarding which is not the desired outcome. .. note:: If the header appears multiple times only the first value is used. Only one of `autoHostRewriteHeader` or `hostRewrite` can be set. |

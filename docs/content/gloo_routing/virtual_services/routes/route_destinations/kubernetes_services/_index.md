description: Routing to services that are registered as Kubernetes Services by querying the Kubernetes API

If you are running Gloo in a Kubernetes cluster, it is possible to directly specify 
[Kubernetes Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) as routing destinations. 
The `kube` destination type has two required fields:

* `ref` is a {{< protobuf name="core.solo.io.ResourceRef">}} to the service that should receive traffic
* `port` is an `int` which represents the port on which the service is listening. This must be one of the ports defined in the Kubernetes service spec

The following configuration will forward all requests to `/petstore` to port `8080` on the Kubernetes service named 
`petstore` in the `default` namespace.

routes:
- matchers:
   - prefix: /petstore
  routeAction:
    single:
      kube:
        ref:
          name: petstore
          namespace: default
        port: 8080

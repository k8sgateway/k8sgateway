description: Follow this guide for hands on, step-by-step tutorial for creating your first virtual service and routing rules in Kubernetes.
---

In this guide, we will introduce Gloo's *Upstream* and *Virtual Service* concepts. 

We will deploy a REST service to Kubernetes using the Pet Store sample application, and we will see that Gloo's Discovery system finds that service
and creates an *Upstream* Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for it, to be used as a destination for routing. 

Next we will create a *Virtual Service* and add routes sending traffic to specific paths on the Pet Store *Upstream* based on incoming web requests, and verify Gloo correctly configures Envoy to route to that endpoint.

Finally, we will test the routes by submitting web requests using `curl`.

{{% notice note %}}
If there are no routes configured, Envoy will not be listening on the gateway port.

## Preparing the Environment

To follow along in this guide, you will need to fulfill a few prerequisites.  

### Prerequisite Software

Your local system should have `kubectl` and `glooctl` installed, and you should have access to a Kubernetes deployment to install the Gloo Gateway.

* [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* `glooctl`
* Kubernetes v1.11.3+ deployed somewhere. [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) is a
great way to get a cluster up quickly.

### Install the Gloo Gateway and glooctl

The [linked guide]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/gateway/kubernetes" >}}) walks you through the process of installing `glooctl` locally and installing the Gloo Gateway on on Kubernetes to the default `gloo-system` namespace.

Once you have completed the installation of `glooctl` and Gloo Gateway, you are now ready to deploy an example application and configure routing.

--- 

## Example Application Setup

On your Kubernetes installation, you will deploy the Pet Store Application and validate this it is operational.

### Deploy the Pet Store Application

First we need to enable function discovery for the `default` namespace by running the following command.

```shell script
kubectl label namespace default discovery.solo.io/function_discovery=enabled
```

Now let's deploy the Pet Store Application on Kubernetes using a YAML file hosted on GitHub. The deployment will stand up the Pet Store container and expose the Pet Store API through a Kubernetes service.

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/gloo/v1.2.9/example/petstore/petstore.yaml
```

```console
deployment.extensions/petstore created
service/petstore created
```

### Verify the Pet Store Application

Now let's verify the pod running the Pet Store application launched successfully the petstore service has been created:

```shell
kubectl -n default get pods
```
```console
NAME                READY  STATUS   RESTARTS  AGE
petstore-####-####  1/1    Running  0         30s
```
If the pod is not yet running, run the `kubectl -n default get pods -w` command and wait until it is. Then enter `Ctrl-C` to break out of the wait loop.

Let's verify that the petstore service has been created as well.

```shell
kubectl -n default get svc petstore
```

Note that the service does not have an external IP address. It is only accessible within the Kubernetes cluster.

```console
NAME      TYPE       CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP  PORT(S)   AGE
petstore  ClusterIP  10.XX.XX.XX  <none>       8080/TCP  1m
```

### Verify the Upstream for the Pet Store Application

The Gloo discovery services watch for new services added to the Kubernetes cluster. We the petstore service was created, Gloo automatically created an Upstream for the petstore service. If everything deployed properly, the Upstream **STATUS** should be **Accepted**. Letâ€™s verify this by using the `glooctl` command line tool:

```shell
glooctl get upstreams
```
```console

+--------------------------------+------------+----------+------------------------------+
```

This command lists all the Upstreams Gloo has discovered, each written to an *Upstream* CRD. 

The upstream we want to see is `default-petstore-8080`. 

Digging a little deeper into the details of the table, we can see that Gloo's function discovery populated our upstream with the available rest endpoints it implements. 
    
{{% notice note %}}
The upstream was created in the `gloo-system` namespace rather than `default` because it was created by a discovery service. Upstreams and Virtual Services do not need to live in the `gloo-system` namespace to be processed by Gloo. 
{{% /notice %}}

### Investigate the YAML of the Upstream

Let's take a closer look at the upstream that Gloo's Discovery service created:

```shell
glooctl get upstream default-petstore-8080 --output kube-yaml
```
```yaml
---
apiVersion: gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: Upstream
metadata:
  labels:
    app: petstore
    discovered_by: kubernetesplugin
  name: default-petstore-8080
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  discoveryMetadata: {}
  kube:
    selector:
      app: petstore
    serviceName: petstore
    serviceNamespace: default
    servicePort: 8080
status:
  reported_by: gloo
  state: 1
```

By default the upstream created is rather simple. It represents a specific kubernetes service. However, the petstore application is
a swagger service. Gloo can discover this swagger spec, but by default Gloo's function discovery features are turned off to improve 
performance. To enable Function Discovery Service (fds) on our petstore, we need to label the namespace.
```shell
kubectl label namespace default  discovery.solo.io/function_discovery=enabled
```

Now fds will discovery the swagger spec.

```shell script
glooctl get upstream default-petstore-8080 --output yaml
```
```yaml
---
discoveryMetadata: {}
kube:
  selector:
    app: petstore
  serviceName: petstore
  serviceNamespace: default
  servicePort: 8080
  serviceSpec:
    rest:
      swaggerInfo:
        url: http://petstore.default.svc.cluster.local:8080/swagger.json
      transformations:
        addPet:
          body:
            text: '{"id": {{ default(id, "") }},"name": "{{ default(name, "")}}","tag":
              "{{ default(tag, "")}}"}'
          headers:
            :method:
              text: POST
            :path:
              text: /api/pets
            content-type:
              text: application/json
        deletePet:
          headers:
            :method:
              text: DELETE
            :path:
              text: /api/pets/{{ default(id, "") }}
            content-type:
              text: application/json
        findPetById:
          body: {}
          headers:
            :method:
              text: GET
            :path:
              text: /api/pets/{{ default(id, "") }}
            content-length:
              text: "0"
            content-type: {}
            transfer-encoding: {}
        findPets:
          body: {}
          headers:
            :method:
              text: GET
            :path:
              text: /api/pets?tags={{default(tags, "")}}&limit={{default(limit, "")}}
            content-length:
              text: "0"
            content-type: {}
            transfer-encoding: {}
metadata:
  labels:
    app: petstore
    discovered_by: kubernetesplugin
  name: default-petstore-8080
  namespace: gloo-system
status:
  reportedBy: gloo
  state: Accepted
```

The application endpoints were discovered by Gloo's Function Discovery (fds) service. This was possible because the petstore application implements OpenAPI (specifically, discovering a Swagger JSON document at `petstore-svc/swagger.json`).  We will use these endpoints to demonstrate function routing in the [next tutorial]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/gloo_routing/virtual_services/routes/route_destinations/single_upstreams/function_routing/" >}}).

---

## Configuring Routing

We have confirmed that the Pet Store application was deployed successfully and that the Function Discovery service on Gloo automatically added an Upstream entry with all the published application endpoints of the Pet Store application. Now let's configure some routing rules on the default Virtual Service.

### Add a Routing Rule

Even though the Upstream has been created, Gloo will not route traffic to it until we add some routing rules on a `virtualservice`. Letâ€™s now use glooctl to create a basic route for this Upstream with the `--prefix-rewrite` flag to rewrite the path on incoming requests to match the path our petstore application expects.

```shell
glooctl add route \
  --path-exact /all-pets \
  --dest-name default-petstore-8080 \
  --prefix-rewrite /api/pets
```

```console
+-----------------+--------------+---------+------+---------+-----------------+---------------------------+
| VIRTUAL SERVICE | DISPLAY NAME | DOMAINS | SSL  | STATUS  | LISTENERPLUGINS |          ROUTES           |
+-----------------+--------------+---------+------+---------+-----------------+---------------------------+
| default         |              | *       | none | Pending |                 | /all-pets -> gloo-system. |
|                 |              |         |      |         |                 | .default-petstore-8080    |
+-----------------+--------------+---------+------+---------+-----------------+---------------------------+
```

The initial **STATUS** of the petstore virtual service will be **Pending**. After a few seconds it should change to **Accepted**. Letâ€™s verify that by retrieving the `virtualservice` with `glooctl`.

```shell
glooctl get virtualservice
```

```console
+-----------------+--------------+---------+------+----------+-----------------+---------------------------+
| VIRTUAL SERVICE | DISPLAY NAME | DOMAINS | SSL  | STATUS   | LISTENERPLUGINS |          ROUTES           |
+-----------------+--------------+---------+------+----------+-----------------+---------------------------+
| default         |              | *       | none | Accepted |                 | /all-pets -> gloo-system. |
|                 |              |         |      |          |                 | .default-petstore-8080    |
+-----------------+--------------+---------+------+----------+-----------------+---------------------------+
```

### Verify Virtual Service Creation

Let's verify that a virtual service was created with that route. 

Routes are associated with virtual services in Gloo. When we created the route in the previous step, we didn't provide a virtual service, so Gloo created a virtual service called `default` and added the route. 

With `glooctl`, we can see that the default virtual service was created with our route:

```shell
glooctl get virtualservice --output yaml
```

{{< highlight yaml >}}
---
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  generation: "3"
  name: default
  namespace: gloo-system
  ownerReferences: []
  resourceVersion: "1018063"
status:
  reportedBy: gateway
  state: Accepted
  subresourceStatuses:
    '*v1.Proxy.gloo-system.gateway-proxy':
      reportedBy: gloo
      state: Accepted
virtualHost:
  domains:
  - '*'
  routes:
  - matchers:
    - exact: /all-pets
    options:
      prefixRewrite: /api/pets
    routeAction:
      single:
        upstream:
          name: default-petstore-8080
          namespace: gloo-system
{{< /highlight >}}
    
When a virtual service is created, Gloo immediately updates the proxy configuration. Since the status of this `virtualservice` is `Accepted`, we know this route is now active. 

At this point we have a `virtualservice` with a routing rule sending traffic on the path `/all-pets` to the `upstream` petstore at a path of `/api/pets`.

### Test the Route Rule

Letâ€™s test the route rule by retrieving the url of the Gloo gateway, and sending a web request to the `/all-pets` path of the url using curl:

```shell
curl $(glooctl proxy url)/all-pets
```

```json
[{"id":1,"name":"Dog","status":"available"},{"id":2,"name":"Cat","status":"pending"}]
```

The proxy has now been configured to route requests to the `/api/pets` REST endpoint on the Pet Store application in Kubernetes.

---

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your first routing rule. That's just the tip of the iceberg though. In the next sections, we'll take a closer look at more HTTP routing capabilities, including [customizing the matching rules]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/gloo_routing/virtual_services/routes/matching_rules" %}}), [route destinations]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/gloo_routing/virtual_services/routes/route_destinations" %}}), and [routing features]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/gloo_routing/virtual_services/routes/routing_features" %}}).

To learn more about the concepts behind Upstreams and Virtual Services check out the [Concepts]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/introduction/concepts/" %}}) page.

If you're ready to dive deeper into routing, the next logical step is trying out different matching rules starting with [Path Matching]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/gloo_routing/virtual_services/routes/matching_rules/path_matching/" %}}).

## Plugins

Gloo invites developers to extend Gloo's functionality and adapt to new use cases via the addition of plugins. 

Gloo's plugin based architecture makes it easy to extend functionality in a variety of areas:

- [Gloo's API](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/tree/master/projects/gloo/api/v1): extensible through the use of [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) along with [Solo-Kit](https://github.com/solo-io/solo-kit)
- [Service Discovery Plugins](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/master/projects/gloo/pkg/discovery/discovery.go#L21): automatically discover service endpoints from catalogs such as [Kubernetes](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/tree/master/projects/gloo/pkg/plugins/kubernetes) and [Consul](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/tree/master/projects/gloo/pkg/plugins/consul)
- [Function Discovery Plugins](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/master/projects/discovery/pkg/fds/interface.go#L31): annotate services with information discovered by polling services directly (such as OpenAPI endpoints and gRPC methods).
- [Routing Plugins](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/master/projects/gloo/pkg/plugins/plugin_interface.go#L53): customize what happens to requests when they match a route or virtual host
- [Upstream Plugins](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/master/projects/gloo/pkg/plugins/plugin_interface.go#L44): customize what happens to requests when they are routed to a service
- **Operators for Configuration**: Gloo exposes its intermediate language for proxy configuration via the [`gloo.solo.io/Proxy`](https://gloo.solo.io/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/proxy.proto.sk/#proxy) Custom Resource, allowing operators to leverage Gloo for multiple use cases. The [Gloo Gateway](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/tree/master/projects/gateway) and [Sqoop](https://github.com/solo-io/sqoop) provide API Gateway and GraphQL Server functionality respectively, without needing to run in the same process (or even the same container) as Gloo.

To get started with development around Gloo, we recommend taking a look at our [Developer Guides]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/dev/" %}}).

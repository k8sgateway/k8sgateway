# Installing on Docker

## Prerequisite

 1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
 2. [glooctl](https://github.com/solo-io/glooctl) v0.3.0 or above.

## Install

 Run the following command to install the files necessary for docker-compose to a folder:

 ```
 glooctl install docker [folder]
 ```

The folder is the folder you want to install the latest version of gloo related files. This sets up the file based storage for gloo. This will also update the glooctl configuration.

For example,

```
glooctl install docker gloo-tutorial
Gloo setup successfully.
Please switch to directory '/Users/ashish/Projects/gloo-tutorial', and run "docker-compose up"
to start gloo.
```

## Running Gloo

You can run `gloo` with docker-compose by changing to the folder and running:

```
cd [folder]

docker-compose up
```

You can check gloo services are running by running `docker ps`

For example,

```
docker ps

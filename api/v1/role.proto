 * A Role is a container for a set of Virtual Services that will be used to generate a single proxy config
 * to be applied to one or more Envoy nodes. The Role is best understood as an in-mesh application's localized view

 * Each domain for each Virtual Service contained in a Role cannot appear more than once, or the Role
 * will be invalid.
 * In the current implementation, Roles are read-only objects created by Gloo for the puprose of reporting.
 * In the future, Gloo will support fields in Roles that can be written to for the purpose of applying policy
 * to groups of Virtual Services.

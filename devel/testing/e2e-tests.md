# In Memory End-to-End tests
These end-to-end tests do not require Kubernetes, and persist configuration in memory.

## Background
This is the most common type of end-to-end test, since it is the quickest to set up and easiest to debug. Additionally, since Gloo Edge may be run using various backing stores, these tests provide a single space to validate the translation of Gloo resources into Envoy resources, independent of where Gloo Edge is deployed. As a result, these test do not rely on Kubernetes, so if there is any Kubernetes behavior that needs to be tested, write a [kubernetes end-to-end test](../kube2e) instead.

### Where are the tests?
The tests are located in the [test/e2e](/test/e2e) folder

### How do the tests work?
1. Run the [Gloo controllers in goroutines](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/1f457f4ef5f32aedabc58ef164aeea92acbf481e/test/services/gateway.go#L109)
1. Run [Envoy](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/1f457f4ef5f32aedabc58ef164aeea92acbf481e/test/services/envoy.go#L237) either using a binary or docker container
1. Apply Gloo resources using [in-memory resource clients](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/1f457f4ef5f32aedabc58ef164aeea92acbf481e/test/services/gateway.go#L175)
1. Execute requests against the Envoy proxy and confirm the expected response. This validates that the Gloo resources have been picked up by the controllers, were been translated correctly into Envoy configuration, the configuration was sent to the Envoy proxy, and the proxy behaves appropriately.

### Example Test
We have an [example test](./example_test.go) which outlines how these tests work. It also provides some examples for basic testing operations. If you are writing a new e2e test, we recommend that you review the example test first.

This was introduced in a [pull request](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/pull/7555) which includes other useful details about e2e test considerations.

## CI
These tests are run by [build-bot](https://github.com/solo-io/build-bot) in Google Cloud as part of our CI pipeline.

If a test fails, you can retry it using the build-bot [comment directives](https://github.com/solo-io/build-bot#issue-comment-directives). If you do this, please make sure to include a link to the failed logs for debugging purposes.

## Local Development
### Setup
For these tests to run, we require that our gateway-proxy component be previously built as a docker image.

If you have not made local changes to the component, you can rely on a previously published image and no setup is required.

However, if you have made changes to the component, refer to the [Envoyinit README](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/main/projects/envoyinit) for build instructions.

### Run Tests
The `test` make target runs ginkgo with a set of useful flags. See [run-tests](./run-tests.md) for more details about common techniques for running tests.  The following environment variables can be configured for this target:

| Name              | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ENVOY_IMAGE_TAG   | ""      | The tag of the gloo-envoy-wrapper-docker image built during setup                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| SERVICE_LOG_LEVEL | ""      | The log levels used for services. See "Controlling Log Verbosity of Services" below.                                                                                                                                                               |    

#### Controlling Log Verbosity of Services
Multiple services (Gloo, Envoy, Discovery) are executed in parallel to run these tests. By default, these services log at the `info` level. To change the log level of a service, set the `SERVICE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to a comma separated list of `service:level` pairs.

Options for services are:
- gateway-proxy
- gloo
- uds
- fds

Options for log levels are:
- debug
- info
- warn
- error

For example, to set the log level of the Gloo service to `debug` and the Envoy service to `error`, you would set:

```bash
SERVICE_LOG_LEVEL=gloo:debug,gateway-proxy:error TEST_PKG=./test/e2e/... make test
```

*If the same service has multiple log levels specified, we will log a warning and the last one defined will be used.*

#### Controlling Log Verbosity of Ginkgo Runner
Ginkgo has 4 verbosity settings, whose details can be found in the [Ginkgo docs](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#controlling-verbosity)

To control these settings, you must pass the flags using the `GINKGO_USER_FLAGS` environment variable.

For example, to set the Ginkgo runner to `very verbose` mode, you would set:
```bash
GINKGO_USER_FLAGS=-vv TEST_PKG=./test/e2e/... make test
```

#### Using Recently Published Image (Most Common)
This is the most common pattern. If you did not make changes to the `gateway-proxy` component, and do not specify an `ENVOY_IMAGE_TAG` our tests will identify the most recently published image (for your LTS branch) and use that version.

```bash
TEST_PKG=./test/e2e/... make test
```

#### Using Previously Published Image
If you want to specify a particular version that was previously published, you can also do that by specifying the `ENVOY_IMAGE_TAG`.

```bash
ENVOY_IMAGE_TAG=1.13.0 TEST_PKG=./test/e2e/... make test
```

#### Using Locally Built Image
If you have made changes to the component, you will have had to rebuild the image locally (see [setup tests](#setup)). After you rebuild the image, you need to supply the tag of that image when running the tests:

```bash
ENVOY_IMAGE_TAG=0.0.1-local TEST_PKG=./test/e2e/... make test
```

#### Running Tests in Parallel
It is possible to run tests in parallel locally, however it is not recommended, because debugging failures becomes more difficult. If you do want to run tests in parallel, you can do so by passing in the relevant `GINKGO_USER_FLAGS` values:
```bash
GINKGO_USER_FLAGS=-procs=4 TEST_PKG=./test/e2e/... make test
```

*Note: When using Docker to run Envoy, we have seen occasional failures: `Error response from daemon: dial unix docker.raw.sock: connect: connection refused`*


### Debugging Tests
#### Use WAIT_ON_FAIL
When Ginkgo encounters a [test failure](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#mental-model-how-ginkgo-handles-failure) it will attempt to clean up relevant resources, which includes stopping the running instance of Envoy, preventing the developer from inspecting the state of the Envoy instance for useful clues.

To avoid this clean up, run the test(s) with `WAIT_ON_FAIL=1`. When the test fails, it will halt execution, allowing you to inspect the state of the Envoy instance.

Once halted, use `docker ps` to determine the admin port for the Envoy instance, and follow the recommendations for [debugging Envoy](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/tree/main/projects/envoyinit#debug), specifically the parts around interacting with the Administration interface.

#### Use INVALID_TEST_REQS
Certain test require environmental conditions to be true for them to succeed. For example, certain tests will only run on a Linux machine.

By setting `INVALID_TEST_REQS=skip`, you can run all tests locally, and any tests which will not run in your local environment will be skipped. The default behavior is that they fail.

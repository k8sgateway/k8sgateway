# Filing Issues

GitHub issues are the main way for reporting bugs and requesting features in Gloo Edge.

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please take the following approach:
1. Search for existing issues.
2. If you find a similar issue, add a comment with additional information or add a 👍 reaction to indicate your agreement.
3. If there are no similar issues, file a new one

Itâ€™s important that every piece of code in Gloo Edge is reviewed by at least one Solo team member familiar with that codebase.

1. **Changelog** Every PR in Gloo Edge needs a changelog entry. For more information about changelogs, see the readme.
2. **CI check** A Solo team member needs to kick off the CI process by commenting /test on your PR.
3. **Testing** Please write tests for your changes. Bias towards fast / unit testing.
4. **Comments** The code reviewer may leave comments to discuss changes. Minor preferences are often called out with nit.

# Backports

## What is a backport?

## When is backporting appropriate?


## How to identify a backport
On the issue that tracks the desired functionality, apply a `release/1.N` label to indicate the version of Gloo Edge you wish the request to be suppoorted on.

For example, if there is a `release/1.14` label, that means the issue is targeted to be introduced first on the stable main branch, and then backported to Gloo Edge 1.14.x.

  description: >-
    * External Processing servers which mutate the body must also send a header mutation to correctly set the Content-Length.
    * This upgrade will cause the HTTP cache to be flushed.
    * Removing a query parameter in the ExtAuth filter no longer causes repeats of that query parameter to be removed.
    * Header mutations at multiple configuration levels are now all applied in order from least to most specific.

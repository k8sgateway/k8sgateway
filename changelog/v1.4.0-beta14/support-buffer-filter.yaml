      description: >
        Gloo now supports enabling the Envoy buffer filter by configuring `spec.httpGateway.options.buffer` of the desired Gateway.
        This is also supported on virtual services at the virtual host or route level, and on weighted destinations.
        See [envoy buffer](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/config/filter/http/buffer/v2/buffer.proto)
        for more details.

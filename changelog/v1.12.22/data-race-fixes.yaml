  fixesIssue: true
  description: >-
    Update validation webhook server and core gloo translation to use the same shared
    translator with proper synchronization, which resolves some rare race conditions
    when applying a bunch of resources at once (with validation enabled).
- type: FIX
  issueLink: https://github.com/solo-io/skv2/issues/375
  fixesIssue: true
  description: >-
    Update construction of `RateLimitConfig` client construction to happen in `init()`
    adding itself to the global scheme before any k8s watches start using the scheme,
    which in rare cases could result in races.

  description: >-
    Use leaner version of hashstructure, that does not read full structs. This helps solve data races
    observed when performing proto.Clone or proto.Marshal in a different goroutine.

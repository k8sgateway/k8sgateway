    description: >-
      Introduce `gateway.validation.webhook.enablePolicyApi` which controls whether or not RouteOptions and
      VirtualHostOptions CRs are subject to validation. By default, this value is true.
      The validation of these Policy APIs only runs if the Kubernetes Gateway integration is enabled (`kubeGateway.enabled`).

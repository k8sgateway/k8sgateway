    description: >
      In active (event-heavy) kubernetes environments, if events come in too quickly, can lead to memory usage growing
      without bound in Gloo and Discovery. Mitigate and slow the leak by using keys in the kubernetes controller
      workqueue that can be compared for equality to de-duplicate them.

    description: >
      Add a default Gloo endpoint warming timeout of fives minutes. Previously, by default Gloo wouldn't wait for endpoints
      to warm before propagating config to Envoy. With this change, Gloo will wait for discovery and EDS to warm before
      propagating config to Envoy, and panic if this doesn't happen within five minutes. This helps prevent unnecessary
      downtime in upgrade scenarios. If `EndpointsWarmingTimeout` is set to zero on the Gloo settings, the old default
      behavior is used (Gloo doesn't wait for EDS or discovery to be ready before propagating config).

    description: >
      Update Envoy to enable thread-local slots to be deallocated on worker
      threads. This provides greater stability in Envoy when the main thread is
      under heavy load. This behaviour can be disabled by toggling the runtime
      flag envoy_restart_features_allow_slot_destroy_on_worker_threads.

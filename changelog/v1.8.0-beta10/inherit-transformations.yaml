    description: >
      `inheritableTransformation` has been moved to StagedTransformations. If `inheritTransformation` is set to true on a child Route Table or Route,
      Parent staged transformations (from a Virtual Host or Route Table) will be appended to a child's [Transformations](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/01d04751f72c168e304977c4f67fdbcbf30232a9/projects/gloo/api/v1/options/transformation/transformation.proto#L44).
      Only the first transformation to match the route will be evaluated, with child transformations receiving priority over parent
      transformations.

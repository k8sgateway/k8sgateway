    Define the API to enforce rate limit policies using `RateLimitConfig` resources. The API allows users to apply
    policies by referencing a set of `RateLimitConfig` resources on `VirtualHosts` and `Routes`. Each resource
    represents a rate limit policy that will be independently enforced on the routing resource that references it.

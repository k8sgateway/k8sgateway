    description: >-
      Provide a Helm field `global.securitySettings.floatingUserId` to apply floatingUserId logic, which unsets `runAsUser`
      for security contexts, for all deployments in the Gloo Helm chart. This functionality has also been added to
      Gloo Gateway via the GatewayParameters resource. If `floatingUserId` is set in GatewayParameters, it will be applied
      to all deployments in the Gloo Gateway Helm chart, unless a deployment-specific value is set.

    description: >-
      Add a new field `global.securitySettings.floatingUserId` to the Gloo Helm chart that has the same effect as
      setting all deployment-specific `floatingUserId` values to the same value. The global value will override any
      local settings.

    description:
      Update `kubectl` image to use USER_ID 10101 to allow resource rollout jobs to run when user id is not set

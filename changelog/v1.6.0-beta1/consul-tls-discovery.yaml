    description: |
      Allow automatic discovery of TLS when using consul services. Requires serveral changes to gloo's helm config to use:
      Set the settings.integrations.consul.useTls flag to true.
      Assign a tag for gloo to recognize as the TLS tag if the default (settings.integrations.consul.tlsTagName=glooUseTls) is insufficient.
      Add the consul root CA for gloo to use at settings.integrations.consul.rootCA
      Once these are setup in gloo, adding the tlsTagName value as a tag to consul services should cause upstreams to automatically
      have TLS when discovered by gloo. Also addresses issue 3698 by adding consul configs into helm.

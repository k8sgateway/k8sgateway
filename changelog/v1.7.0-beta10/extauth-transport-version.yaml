changelog:
- type: NEW_FEATURE
  description: >
    Added the new `use_v3_transport_api` field to the `extauth` settings. If this field is set to `true`,
    Gloo Edge will configure Envoy to communicate with the external auth server using `V3` of the `ext_authz` API.
    The field defaults to `false`, in which case `V2` of the API will continue being used. This was done to maintain
    compatibility with existing custom auth servers.
    Note that in order for the external auth server to be able to emit dynamic metadata the field needs to be set to `true`.
    For more info, see the `transport_api_version` field
    [here](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/http/ext_authz/v3/ext_authz.proto#extensions-filters-http-ext-authz-v3-extauthz).

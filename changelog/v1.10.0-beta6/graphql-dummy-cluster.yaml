    description: > 
      Due to an upstream envoy issue where the cors filter is disabled on direct response action routes, we are switching the way in which 
      we configure graphql routes. Previously they used a direct response action, but now they will use a graphql "dummy" cluster. This cluster is
      never used, similar to the direct response action, but is simply a destination which is required for the route configuration. The graphql
      filter will handle routing, so this is not an important change but merely one needed to make CORS work.

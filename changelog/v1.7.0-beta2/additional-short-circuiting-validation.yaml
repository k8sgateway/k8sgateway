      Gloo Edge now proactively reports warnings on virtual services that have matchers that are short-circuited.
      To enable, update the Gloo `Settings` such that `spec.gateway.validation.warnRouteShortCircuiting=true`
      The cases now additionally covered are:
        - routes that have simple OR regex header matchers, ensuring each one of the OR'ed matchers can be reached
        - the same logic, but with method matchers

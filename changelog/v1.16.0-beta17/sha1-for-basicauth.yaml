    description: >
      Add support to use sha1 for basic auth. This requires extended the basic auth API to allow selection of an excyption algorithm.
      While extending the API, we had to create a new method of defining the users, and we took this opportunity to add support for
      sources of data other than an inline list in anticipation of being asked to support user credentials from a secret.
      Please note that sha1 is considered insecure and should not be used in production.

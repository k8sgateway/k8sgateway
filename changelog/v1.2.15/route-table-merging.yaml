changelog:
- type: NON_USER_FACING
  description: >
    Update the API to support delegating to multiple route tables. Route tables to delegate to can be selected by both
    namespace and labels. The routes of all matching route tables will be merged and the resulting route set will be
    sorted by descending specificity of the matchers on each route.
    Marking this as non user facing as this change only updates the API but does not implement the feature.

- type: FIX
  description: >
    Update the delegation API to support delegating to multiple route tables. Route tables to delegate to can be
    selected by either namespaces, labels, or both, using the new `RouteTableSelector` field.
    The routes of all matching route tables will be merged and the resulting route set will be sorted by descending
    specificity of the matchers on each route, i.e. matchers with longer prefixes will appear first (delegated routes can only have prefix matchers).

changelog:
- type: NEW_FEATURE
  description: >
    Update the delegation API to support delegating to multiple route tables. Route tables to delegate to can be
    selected by either namespaces, labels, or both, using the new `RouteTableSelector` field.
    The routes of all matching route tables will be merged and the resulting route set will be sorted by descending
    specificity of the matchers on each route, i.e. matchers with longer prefixes will appear first (delegated routes can only have prefix matchers).

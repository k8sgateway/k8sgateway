    description: >
      GlooE depends on Gloo v1.2.12. We released [v1.2.13](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.2.13) and
      [v1.2.14](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.2.14) off of master (with new features) instead this
      branch, `v1.2.x`, which was incorrect.

      To account for this, we skip `v1.2.13` and `v1.2.14` tags on this branch. This file exists to ensure that the
      next release tag is `v1.2.15`, which is the successor for `v1.2.12`, which Gloo Enterprise 1.2.0 tracks.

    description: >-
      Plugs a gap where go would check a secret for validity per spec but envoy is more aggressive.
      For example a tls secret with a certchain that contains an invalid pem block will be rejected by envoy but not go.
      Prior to this pr these types of secrets would be accepted by gloo and nacked by envoy.

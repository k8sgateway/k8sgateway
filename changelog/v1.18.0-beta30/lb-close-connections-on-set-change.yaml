    description: >-
      Allow setting the Envoy LB policy to drain connections when the upstream host set changes.
      This is useful when using Ring Hash or Maglev load balancing policies and helps ensure
      rebalancing when recovering from disruptions. Connections are not immediately
      closed and are allowed to drain. This feature is disabled by default.

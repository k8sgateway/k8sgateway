    resolvesIssue: false
    description: >-
      Introduce retries to the kube2e curl helper, so that curl requests which may fail due to
      network issues, will not cause tests to fail. This has demonstrated to reduce flakes,
      though it has not proven that it will fix this test flake completely, so it is not
      marked as resolving the issue.

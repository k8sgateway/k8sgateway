    description: >
      GlooE depends on Gloo v1.2.12. We released [v1.2.14](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.2.14) off of
      master (with new features) instead this branch, `v1.2.x`, which was incorrect.

      To account for this, we will skip this tag on this branch, and the next valid 1.2.x tag should come from this
      branch.

      v1.2.14 was marked as a pre-release.

changelog:
- type: NON_USER_FACING
  description: >-
    Change the image used in our kubernetes/e2e tests from kennship/http-echo
    to jmalloc/echo-server. This image supports http/2. It is also smaller and
    faster, which may speed up our e2e tests and reduce CI costs.
    kennship/http-echo is also an archived project that appears to not have
    been updated in 6 years.

  - type: FIX
    description: Fix incorrect CRD generation of proto fileds of type `google.protobuf.UInt64Value`. Previously fields of this type had an incorrect schema which led to them failing being unmarshalled, which is now resolved. Affected protos include gateway specs `httpGateway.options.caching.maxPayloadSize` and `httpGateway.options.connectionLimit.maxActiveConnections`

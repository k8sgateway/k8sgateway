- type: FIX
  description: >
    With `disableProxyGarbageCollection` enabled (the default), Gloo used to clear the extauth
    and ratelimit snapshots from the XDS cache, resulting in null configurations temporarily in
    the extauth and ratelimit services. This caused blips of invalid 403/429 responses. To fix this,
    Gloo now detects any valid `TranslatorSyncerExtension`'s Envoy Node ID keys through its `Sync()`
    function, so Gloo doesn't garbage collect these snapshots anymore.

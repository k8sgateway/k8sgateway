    description: >
      Gloo now supports enabling the upstream Envoy CSRF filter by configuring `spec.httpGateway.options.csrf` of
      the desired Gateway. This can also be overridden on virtual services at the virtual host or route level,
      and on weighted destinations. See [envoy csrf](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/config/filter/http/csrf/v2/csrf.proto)
      for more details.

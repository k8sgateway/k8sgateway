changelog:
- type: HELM
  description: >
    Allow RBAC resource names to receive custom suffixes through the introduction of the new
    Helm setting "global.glooRbac.nameSuffix". This enables, for example, blue/green
    deployments of Gloo to different namespaces within the same cluster when using
    cluster-scoped RBAC resources. This change is backwards compatible. However, if you are
    performing an upgrade of Gloo from a version prior to this change and plan to use the new
    Helm value, then you may end up with duplicate RBAC resources in your cluster (e.g.
    Roles/RoleBindings with and without the suffix). If this is the case, the old resources
    (without the suffix) can be safely cleaned up.

changelog:
- type: HELM
  description: >
    Allow RBAC cluster-scoped role names to receive custom suffixes. This enables, for example,
    blue/green deployments of Gloo to different namespaces within the same cluster. If you are
    performing an upgrade of Gloo from a version prior to this change, then you may have
    duplicate roles/role-bindings hanging around in your cluster. The ones created prior to this
    version can be safely cleaned up.

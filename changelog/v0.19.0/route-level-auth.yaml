- type: BREAKING_CHANGE
  description: >
    Update the external auth APIs to support configuring authentication/authorization on **routes and weighted
    destinations**, in addition to virtual hosts. The auth configuration that currently is defined directly on the
    virtual service/proxy resources (under virtualHostPlugins) will become a top-level solo-kit resource (in the
    context of Kubernetes this means **a new CRD**). Resources that need to use a particular auth configuration can
    now just reference the correspondent new `AuthConfig` resource. The advantages of this change are twofold: besides
    reducing the duplication of configuration, it guarantees the stability of secured upstreams between auth
    configuration updates.

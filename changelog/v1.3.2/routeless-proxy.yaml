changelog:
- type: FIX
  description: >
      Introduce a feature flag in the Settings CRD named proxyGarbageCollection, 
      located under the 'gloo' options. Set this option to determine the state of
      the envoy configuration when a virtual service is deleted, resulting in a
      proxy with no configured routes.
      Set to true if you wish to reset the envoy configuration to a clean slate with no routes.
      Set to false if you wish to keep envoy serving the routes from the latest valid configuration.
      For this release, proxyGarbageCollection will default to 'false'.

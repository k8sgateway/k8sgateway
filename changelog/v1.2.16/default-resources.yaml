changelog:
- type: FIX
  description: >
    Settings and Gateway resources currently get automatically created when the `gloo` and `gateway` pods
    (respectively) start up. This creates a race condition with our installation that we currently solve by
    creating our default Settings and Gateways as Helm Hook resources, which means that they are not
    managed as a part of the Helm release lifecycle. With this change removes the automatic generation feature.
    Note that the default Settings and Gateway resources in the Helm chart are still marked as Helm hooks.

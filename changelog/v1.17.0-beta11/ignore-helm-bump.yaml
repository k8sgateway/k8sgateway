  description: >
    Choosing to ignore helm upgrade, as it does not impact the data and control planes of Gloo Edge. This only impacts glooctl and panics will not affect future uses of glooclt. The fix to bump helm will also require bumping the k8s dependencies by several minor versions in <=1.15 that can cause issues. As it also has a simple resolution on the client side, it is therefore deemed to have little to no impact.

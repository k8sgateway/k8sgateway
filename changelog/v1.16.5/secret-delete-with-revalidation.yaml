      Update to allow deletion of secrets when warnings or errors are present.

      When the deletion of a secret is validated, the validating admission webhook removes the secret from the current snapshot,
      runs translations and looks for errors. Previously, the secret would not be deleted if there were errors, or if there
      were warnings and the `ignore_warnings` setting was set as `false`. This casues issues when trying to delete secrets that
      are unrelated to the warnings or errors.

      The new behavior is to collect all the artifacts of the valdiation process, rerun validation against the original snapshot,
      and compare the artifacts from that process to the artifacts previously collected. If the artifacts are the same, the secret
      did not degrade the system and the deletion is allowed. If the artifacts are different, the secret is not deleted and errors are returned.

      Because this is a backport, the new behavior is disabled by default in order not to alter existing behavior. This feature can be 
      turned on by setting the `DISABLE_VALIDATION_AGAINST_PREVIOUS_STATE` environment variable to `false` in the `gloo` deployment.
      A dedicated helm value has not been added, and the environment variable can be set using `gloo.gloo.deployment.customEnv`

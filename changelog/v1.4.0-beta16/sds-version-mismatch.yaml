  description: >
    Re add SDS V2 API to SDS container along side new V3 API so that both may run simultaneously while we
    transition to V3 API in envoy across different components. This change only affects gloo running in MTLS mode.
    In addition, removing the top level locality field of the Failover API introduce in `v1.4.0-beta15` as it does not
    have any meaningful effect on the underlying implementation.

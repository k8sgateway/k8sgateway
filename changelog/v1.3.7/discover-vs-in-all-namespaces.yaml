  - type: BREAKING_CHANGE
    description: >
      When a Gateway has an empty httpGateway.virtualServiceNamespaces list, include all virtual services in the cluster.
      Previously the behavior was to include only virtual services in the same namespace as the gateway,
      which has proven unintuitive to users.

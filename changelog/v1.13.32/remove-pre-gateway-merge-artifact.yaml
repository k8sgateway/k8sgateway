  description: >- 
    Removes a flakey test that also had weird interactions with grpc.
    Safe to remove as the robust client is no longer used as it was part of the old methodology of validation -> gateway communication
    All references to the robust client were removed here:  https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/commit/bc380b36d42fdad7c83ab8dc4f055258b326aeac#diff-c85bd99ea468f5c006633ae3a44e1b569ff3af830e1c632870ddf222fc224205L271
    While this method is Exported it is generally unsafe to use even for client libraries. Given this we wont remove it from 1.12 but will remove it going forward.
    If a similar function is needed it is better to roll your own grpc connection logic that also wraps our validation request.
    If a similar function is implemented the existing test is generally good for logic but makes assumptions about the grpc backoff and retry connections.

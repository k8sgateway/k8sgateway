  An Envoy-Powered API Gateway
</h1>

## Important Update

> **Important**
> Gloo Gateway is now a fully conformant Kubernetes Gateway API implementation!
>
> The existing Gloo Edge v1 APIs were not changed and continue to be fully supported. To find the latest version for the Gloo Edge v1 API, see the [main branch](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/tree/main).

## About Gloo Gateway
Gloo Gateway is a feature-rich, Kubernetes-native ingress controller and next-generation API gateway based on the Kubernetes Gateway API. Gloo Gateway is exceptional in its function-level routing; its support for legacy apps, microservices and serverless; its discovery capabilities; its numerous features; and its tight integration with leading open-source projects. Gloo Gateway is uniquely designed to support hybrid applications in which multiple technologies, architectures, protocols, and clouds can coexist.

## Quickstart
Install Gloo Gateway and set up routing to the httpbin sample app. 

1. Install `glooctl`, the Gloo Gateway command line tool.
   ```sh
   curl -sL https://run.solo.io/gloo/install | GLOO_VERSION=v2.0.0-beta1 sh
   export PATH=$HOME/.gloo/bin:$PATH
   ```

2. Install the Gloo Gateway v2 control plane, and wait for it to come up
   ```sh
   glooctl install
   kubectl rollout status deployment -n gloo-system -w
   ```

3. Deploy the httpbin sample app.
   ```sh
   kubectl create ns httpbin
   kubectl -n httpbin apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/gloo-mesh-use-cases/main/policy-demo/httpbin.yaml
   ```

4. Create an HTTPRoute resource to expose the httpbin app on the gateway. The following example exposes the app on the `wwww.example.com` domain.
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: httpbin
     namespace: httpbin
      labels:
        example: httpbin-route
   spec:
     parentRefs:
       - name: http
         namespace: gloo-system
     hostnames:
       - "www.example.com"
     rules:
       - backendRefs:
           - name: httpbin
             port: 8000
   EOF
   ```

5. Port-forward the HTTP gateway service.
   ```sh
   kubectl port-forward svc -n gloo-system gloo-proxy-http 8080:8080 &
   ```

6. Send a request to the httpbin app and verify that you get back a 200 HTTP response code.
   ```
   curl -vik localhost:8080/status/200 -H "host: www.example.com"
   ```

Congratulations! You successfully installed Gloo Gateway and used an HTTP gateway to expose the httpbin sample app.

### Using Gloo Gateway
- **Kubernetes Gateway API**: Gloo Gateway is a feature-rich ingress controller, built on top of the Envoy Proxy and fully conformant with the Kubernetes Gateway API.
- **Next-generation API gateway**: Gloo Gateway provides a long list of API gateway features including rate limiting, circuit breaking, retries, caching, transformation, service-mesh integration, security, external authentication and authorization.
- **Hybrid apps**: Gloo Gateway creates applications that route to backends implemented as microservices, serverless functions and legacy apps. This feature can help users to -
A) Gradually migrate from their legacy code to microservices and serverless.
B) Add new functionalities using cloud-native technologies while maintaining their legacy codebase.
C) Allow different teams in an organization choose different architectures. See here for more on the Hybrid App paradigm.


### What makes Gloo Gateway unique
- **Function-level routing allows integration of legacy applications, microservices and serverless**: Gloo Gateway can route requests directly to functions. Request to Function can be a serverless function call (e.g. Lambda, Google Cloud Function, OpenFaaS Function, etc.), an API call on a microservice or a legacy service (e.g. a REST API call, OpenAPI operation, XML/SOAP request etc.), or publishing to a message queue (e.g. NATS, AMQP, etc.). This unique ability is what makes Gloo Gateway the only API gateway that supports hybrid apps as well as the only one that does not tie the user to a specific paradigm.
- **Gloo Gateway incorporates vetted open-source projects to provide broad functionality**: Gloo Gateway supports high-quality features by integrating with top open-source projects, including gRPC, GraphQL, OpenTracing, NATS and more. Gloo Gateway's architecture allows rapid integration of future popular open-source projects as they emerge.
 **Full automated discovery lets users move fast**: Upon launch, Gloo Gateway creates a catalog of all available destinations and continuously maintains it up to date. This takes the responsibility for 'bookkeeping' away from the developers and guarantees that new features become available as soon as they are ready. Gloo Gateway discovers across IaaS, PaaS and FaaS providers as well as Swagger, gRPC, and GraphQL.

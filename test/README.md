## Debugging Tests

# Gloo Tests

Some of the gloo tests use a listener on 127.0.0.1 rather than 0.0.0.0 and will only run on linux (e.g. fault injection).

If youâ€™re developing on a mac, ValidateBootstrap will not run properly because it uses the envoy binary for validation mode (which only runs on linux). See rbac_jwt_test.go for an example.

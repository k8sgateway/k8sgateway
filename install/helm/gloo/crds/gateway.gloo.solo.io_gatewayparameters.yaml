                                  HostProcess determines if a container should be run as a 'Host Process' container.
                                  All of a Pod's containers must have the same effective HostProcess value
                                  (it is not allowed to have a mix of HostProcess containers and non-HostProcess containers).
                                  In addition, if HostProcess is true then HostNetwork must also be set to true.

                                  May also be set in PodSecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and
                                  PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

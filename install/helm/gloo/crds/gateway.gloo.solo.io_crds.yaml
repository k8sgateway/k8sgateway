              provision Gloo Gateway's data plane (Envoy proxy instance), based on a

                                          The scheduler will prefer to schedule pods to nodes that satisfy
                                          the anti-affinity expressions specified by this field, but it may choose
                                          a node that violates one or more of the expressions. The node that is
                                          most preferred is the one with the greatest sum of weights, i.e.

                                          request, requiredDuringScheduling anti-affinity expressions, etc.),
                                          compute a sum by iterating through the elements of this field and adding
                                          "weight" to the sum if the node has pods which matches the corresponding podAffinityTerm; the
